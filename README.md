# Learning Projects 

## Background 

I have created this new repository where I will be uploading my data analytics and machine learning projects as and when I work on them. Some of the datasets that I have worked on currently are quite popular beginner level projects. Most projects are used as a way to explain one analytics concept or ML model. Later, I hope to apply these learnings to real-world datasets. 

## Built with

I have used python as my primary programming language for coding. All these notebooks were built using Jupyter Notebook 

## Closing comments 

Please feel free to provide your inputs on any of the projects as you deem might be helpful in my learning journey. Thanks for reading!
